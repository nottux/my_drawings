# my_drawings
~My drawings, mostly from high school years~

The repository of most drawings i posses.
If the said image is not here (like the flicker ones) that means they are the source file and i couldn't found them from my backups. That doesn't mean i don't posses them but simply some major annoyences like them being in .heic format and no thumbnail creation because of that etc...

You can find  my drawings and photos under;
